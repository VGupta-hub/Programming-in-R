Visualising the relationships in hotel_bookings data

Scenario:
In this scenario, you are a junior data analyst working for a hotel booking company. 
You have cleaned and manipulated your data, and gotten some initial insights you would like to share. 
Now, you are going to create some simple data visualizations with the `ggplot2` package. 
You will use basic `ggplot2` syntax and troubleshoot some common errors you might encounter.

## Step 1: Import your data
> hotel_bookings = read.csv("C:/Users/vgupt/Desktop/Coursera/R/hotel_bookings.csv")

## Step 2: Look at a sample of your data
> head(hotel_bookings)

## Step 3: Install and load the 'ggplot2' package
> install.packages('ggplot2')
> library(ggplot2)

## Step 4: Begin creating a plot
> ggplot(data = hotel_bookings)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x=lead_time, y= children))

On the x-axis, the plot shows how far in advance a booking is made, with the bookings furthest to the right happening the most in advance. 
On the y-axis it shows how many children there are in a party.

The plot reveals that your stakeholder's hypothesis is incorrect. 
You report back to your stakeholder that many of the advanced bookings are being made by people with 0 children.

Now try mapping 'stays_in_weekend_nights' on the x-axis and 'children' on the y-axis by filling out the remainder of the code below.
> ggplot(data=hotel_bookings)+geom_point(mapping = aes(x=stays_in_weekend_nights, y=children))

You will discover that guests with no children book most of the weekend nights. So you can target that group in a new marketing campaign.
